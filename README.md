# snapConverter
This is the source code for two webapps that convert snap projects for the finch and hummingbird. This is needed because projects can be made in two different ways (chrome app and birdbrainserver/iPad).

Inside the hummingbird and finch folder of this directory you will see an app and a dist folder. The app folder contains the unformatted code for the websites and the dist folder contains the formatted code. 
The dist folder should be used for distribution.
