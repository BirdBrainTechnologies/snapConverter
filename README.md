# snapConverter

The script in this repo generates all the snap! project files provided by BirdBrain
Technologies. Changes needed in these files should be made here and new projects
generated.



The old converters (now in the oldConverters folder) were designed to translate
between the web app version and bluebird or robotserver version. This is no longer
necessary. See the README in the oldConverters folder for more details.
